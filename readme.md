# React API Integration – Real Admin Dashboard

This project demonstrates **real-world API integration in React**
using an **admin-style dashboard**, not a simple auto-load list.

It is designed for students to understand how **actual dashboards**
fetch, refresh, search, and manage API data.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

- Manual API fetching (button-based, like real dashboards)
- Loading state handling
- Error handling with retry
- Search & filtering
- Refresh data
- Last fetched timestamp
- Clean separation of logic (service layer)

---

## ❌ What This Project Does NOT Do

- No auto-fetch on page load
- No fake demo behavior
- No unrealistic examples

👉 This makes it **industry-oriented**, not tutorial-only.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Scenario

In real admin panels:
- Data is fetched when the user clicks a button
- Loading indicators are shown
- Errors are handled gracefully
- Users can refresh and search data

This project follows the **same real flow**.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- `fetch()` API usage
- `useState` for UI state
- `useEffect` for cleanup
- `useRef` for request cancellation
- `useMemo` for optimized search filtering
- Service-based API architecture
